# The PA Directory Search Engine

## What to write here
You should present the following complexity analysis in this report:

+ Big-O complexity of the indexing operation.
+ Big-O complexity of a search operation (given that indexing has been done already).
+ Big-O complexity of a search operation if it were implemented in a brute force fashion (that is, no indexing performed, all search queries go through the entire text of all files every time).

You should be very clear about what you mean by n when presenting your Big-O complexity analysis.
